# Will-o'-the-Wisp
<p>Will-o'-the-Wisp creature mod for Dayz. Will-o'-the-Wisp tries to catch player and charge into him causing unconscious state for 10 seconds, small random damage and optionally steals one random item from player. After charge, Will-o'-the-Wisp is idle for 20 seconds giving 10s for recovery and escape. Will-o'-the-Wisp always goes to last seen player position. It is possible to hide from it or just run away.</p>

### API
**_Get_ab_WillowispManager().CreateRandomWillowispController(string name, vector position, float resetRadius, float radius, int willowispCount)_**

Creates circular Will-o'-the-Wisp infested area with size of radius at position and randomly fills it with willowispCount Will-o'-the-Wisps. Area resets everytime no players are inside resetRadius. You can name area with name parameter to see it in logs.

**_Get_ab_WillowispManager().CreatePredefinedWillowispController(string name, vector position, float resetRadius, ref array<string> willowispPositions)_**
  
Creates predefined Will-o'-the-Wisp infested area with logical center position and fills it with Will-o'-the-Wisps from willowispPositions string array that contains coords in vector format. Area resets everytime no players are inside resetRadius. You can name area with name parameter to see it in logs.

**_ab_Willowisp_Stealable_Items_**
Static string array that defines stealable items that Will-o'-the-Wisp is allowed to steal from knocked down player after successful attack. Array is initialized and empty by default.

```
ab_Willowisp_Stealable_Items.Clear();
ab_Willowisp_Stealable_Items.Insert("NVGoggles");
ab_Willowisp_Stealable_Items.Insert("BandageDressing");
